# Discovery of Energy Storage Materials via Bayesian optimization
## Background
Non-aqueous redox flow batteries (NRFBs) are a promising technology for stationary energy applications. However, after many charge/discharge cycles, the charge-carrying materials, or redoxmers, can become damaged and thus reduce the longevity of NRFBs. One approach to circumvent such problem is to design recyclable redoxmers via mesolytic cleavage reactions. In a nutshell, mesolytic cleavage allows us trigger favorable bond cleavage of a molecule at a specific applied potential, and therefore enables programmable destruction and subsequent regenertion of damaged redoxmers. As a first step toward designing sustainable NRFBs, this work aims to quickly and efficiently discover redoxmers, based on a homobenzylic ether scafford, of desired redox potentials via Bayesian optimization.
